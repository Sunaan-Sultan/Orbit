/**
 * The app's event taxonomy, and the one place any of it is named.
 *
 * Space Facts ships ads and a paid ad-free upgrade while measuring nothing: there is no way
 * to tell which facts are watched, where a session ends, or whether a change to the ad cap
 * helped or hurt. Every call site is wired here so that question becomes answerable.
 *
 * **No events leave the device yet.** Attaching a provider is deliberately the last step,
 * because it is the only part that needs an account: add the Firebase Analytics dependency
 * and `app/google-services.json`, then set [sink] from `MainActivity.onCreate` —
 *
 * ```
 * Analytics.sink = Analytics.Sink { event, params ->
 *     Firebase.analytics.logEvent(event, bundleOf(*params.toList().toTypedArray()))
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Until then a debug build logs to logcat, so the call sites can be verified without one.

/**
 * Picks the one fact the app leads with today — the "Today" card, the reminder
 * notification and any other daily surface must all agree, so they all come through here.
 *
 * The choice is a pure function of the day, which keeps it stable across relaunches and
 * across processes (the notification worker never talks to the UI) without storing
 * anything. The catalog is walked as a shuffled cycle rather than sampled at random, so no
 * fact repeats until every other one has had its turn; each cycle reshuffles on its own
 * seed, so the order differs from one pass to the next.

/**
 * A run of consecutive active days, and the short history behind it.
 *
 * All of the streak's day arithmetic lives here, as a value type with no Android imports, so
 * it can be reasoned about and tested without a device. [OrbitPrefs] is only the shell that
 * reads these four numbers off disk, applies a transform, and writes them back.
 *
 * ## Why the history is a bitmask
 *
 * The week dots need to answer "was the app used on day X" for the last seven days. Storing a
 * set of day indices would mean a growing string set that has to be swept for old entries.
 * Instead bit *i* of [mask] means "the day `lastDay - i` was active". That is one `putInt`, it
 * expires on its own (anything older than [HISTORY_DAYS] shifts off the top edge and is gone),
 * and — because the anchor is [lastDay], which is already persisted — **reading never writes**.
 * A reader on a later day simply indexes further up the mask and finds zeroes.
